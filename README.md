## Description
This program converts a user's inputted age on Earth into an age on various solar planets including Mercury, Venus, Mars and Jupiter. For example, a solar year lasts 365 days on Earth, but only 88 days on Mars. In addition, the program calculates life expectancy on different planets based on a user's current age. 

## Behaviors

| Spec| Example input | Example Output
| ----------- | ----------- | ----------- |
_Mercury age_
 If a user is 38 years old on Earth, their age on Mercury is .24 Earth years and 38 /(.24) = 158 years old |

__Venus age
| If a user is 60 years old on Earth, their age on Venus is .62 Earth years and 60 /(.62) = 97 years old__

__Mars age
| If a user is 20 years old on Earth, their age on Mars is 1.88 Earth years and 20 /(1.88) = 11 years old__


__Jupiter age
| If a user is 70 years old on Earth, their age on Jupiter is 11.86 Earth years and 70 /(11.86) = 6 years old__
